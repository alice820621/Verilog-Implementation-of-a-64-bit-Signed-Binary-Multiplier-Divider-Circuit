# Verilog-Implementation-of-a-64-bit-Signed-Binary-Multiplier-Divider-Circuit
There are no explicit arithmetic operators used in the design (i.e: +,-). The design is built upon instantiation of a 2-bit adder to achieve 32-bit operation. The 64-bit sequential multiplier and divider share the 32-bit adder when in use.
